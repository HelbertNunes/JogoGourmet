Hello!
This is my version of the Jogo Gourmet example. I'm adding this README file to point some developing decisions I made during the proccess:

-- I've made the code as simple as possible to respect the scope of the solution.
-- I couldn't manage to make the solution work properly. I'm sending the text for the code and structure evaluation
-- My ideia was to divide the solution into yes and no parts and try to make the selections in the memory dinamically but it didnt worked 
-- My first idea was to make everything in a stack, don't know if would work but the other approach I tried didn't
-- At the start I tought to made a solution with a proper database, or a txt file to persist the added dishes but I don't think that is the point of the test, so I just made it in memory and every time the aplication is closed it starts again.
-- The new dishes can't be created without a description. The given example "Bolo de chocolate",don't have a description, the application starts with "Feijão tropeiro" that have a description and next ones you input will require a description as well.
